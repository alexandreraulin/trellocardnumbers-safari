### Thanks

Thanks to [@mikespokefire](http://twitter.com/mikespokefire) for the original Chrome version that got me through the cold winter nights (available [here](https://github.com/mikespokefire/card_numbers_for_trello)).

Thanks to Trello for a) being awesome and b) basically doing all the work for me, and then just putting a `hide` class on it. You should probably just making this a setting. Either way, much love <3
